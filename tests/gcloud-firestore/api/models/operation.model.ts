If the original method is standard`Get`/`Create`/`Update`, the response should be the resource.  For othermethods, the response should have the type `XxxResponse`, where `Xxx`is the original method name.  For example, if the original method nameis `TakeSnapshot()`, the inferred response type is`TakeSnapshotResponse`.
