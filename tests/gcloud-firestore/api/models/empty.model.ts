/**
 * A generic empty message that you can re-use to avoid defining duplicated
 * empty messages in your APIs. A typical example is to use it as the request
 * or the response type of an API method. For instance:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 *     service Foo {
 * 
 *       rpc Bar(google.protobuf.Empty) returns (google.protobuf.Empty);
 * 
 *     }
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * The JSON representation for `Empty` is empty JSON object `{}`.
